# README - CodebyCL 🚀

## Overview 📚
Welcome to **CodebyCL**, a collection of various scripts and code snippets written by Carlo Leonardi as part of his PhD research. This repository contains implementations that were used in published research as well as exploratory analysis scripts focused on spatial transcriptomics (ST).

## Repository Structure 
The repository consists of the following folders:

### 1. `PDAC_Nature2023_CL` 🧬
This folder contains scripts originally written by Carlo Leonardi for the paper published in *Nature (2023)*, focusing on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The scripts involve analyses for scRNA-seq mice data processing and integration, Visium analysis for the mice orthotopic tumors and the kNN analysis code on the Molecular Cartography data.
### 2. `Random kNNs for ST` 🔄
This folder contains an analysis involving random k-nearest neighbor (kNN) calculations for spatial transcriptomics (ST). The analysis aims to explore the spatial organization of cell types by calculating randomized kNN graphs, helping to uncover cell-cell interactions and tissue architecture. This work is particularly relevant in understanding the complexity and spatial heterogeneity of tissues. This script contains very useful functions and statistical suggestions to explore, in a statistical sound way, the heterogeneity of ST experiments.The functions provided in this folder are very useful and open source, though it would be nice to be cited if you use them in your work.
